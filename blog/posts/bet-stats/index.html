            class="c13">Proble</span><span class="c9 c4 c3">m Statement </span></h1>
    <p class="c8"><span>Prior to this project, my experience was almost entirely centered on building full-stack
            websites&mdash;designing interfaces, managing databases, and implementing backend logic using tools like
            PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this gave me a strong foundation in building end-to-end applications,
            I wanted to </span><span class="c4">widen my skill set and move closer to the data side of
            problem-solving</span><span class="c2 c3">.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>This project was a deliberate step in that direction. Through </span><span class="c12">Bet
            Stats</span><span>, my goal was not just to build another web application, but to integrate Python-based
            analytics into my existing projects in order to generate meaningful insights and visualizations around
            player performance and game trends. It marked an intentional shift from focusing solely on application
            structure to focusing on </span><span class="c4">how data is processed, analyzed, and
            communicated</span><span class="c2 c3">.</span></p>
    <p class="c8 c14"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c17" id="h.vgkhfrewdxk0"><span>1</span><span>&nbsp;Exploratory Analysis</span></h1>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">Although this project was not designed around formal statistical inference,
            exploratory data analysis played a key role in shaping the analytical layer of the application. Using Python
            and Pandas, I explored player-level and game-level datasets to understand distributions, variability, and
            emerging patterns in performance metrics.</span></p>

            class="c0">System workflow used to facilitate exploratory data analysis across a web-based and Python-hosted
            environment</span><span class="c0">.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>This exploratory process helped me determine which statistics were meaningful to visualize and
            which were too noisy or inconsistent for user-facing insights. In this context, EDA functioned as a
            practical decision-making tool&mdash;bridging raw data and visualization by clarifying what information
            would actually be useful to users.</span></p>
    <p class="c15"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h1 class="c16" id="h.pmbj0cqwfcca"><span class="c9 c4 c1">2 Methodology</span></h1>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">To integrate Python analytics into a website I had already built, I initially set
            up a separate Python server alongside my PHP-based web server. The architecture involved sending requests
            from the main server to the Python server, which processed the data, generated graphs using Matplotlib, and
            returned the images to be rendered on the site.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">While this approach worked, it introduced performance delays and additional
            complexity due to cross-server communication. As I evaluated the trade-offs, I decided to simplify the
            system by allowing the Python server to render visualizations directly within an HTML page.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">This decision reduced overhead, improved performance, and allowed me to focus more
            on data handling, transformation, and visualization rather than maintaining an overly complex
            infrastructure.</span></p>
    <p class="c8 c14"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p>
    <p class="c11"><span
            style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 213.00px; height: 597.00px;"><img

    <p class="c15"><span class="c12 c4 c0">Figure 2&mdash;</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;</span><span
            class="c0 c2">The diagram illustrates how user-selected data is exported from Bet Stats, processed through
            an automated Python-based exploratory data analysis pipeline, and transformed into dynamic visualizations
            and summaries that support interpretation and insight discovery.</span></p>
    <p class="c15 c14"><span class="c2 c0"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c16" id="h.1ob5komhk1mq"><span class="c1">3 Results</span></h1>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">The final implementation successfully generated dynamic visualizations based on
            uploaded CSV data, allowing player and game statistics to be analyzed and displayed through a Python-driven
            workflow.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>By simplifying the architecture, the application became more responsive and easier to maintain.
            More importantly, it enabled me to spend more time working with the data itself&mdash;cleaning,
            transforming, and visualizing it&mdash;rather than managing server-to-server communication.</span></p>
    <p class="c8 c14"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p>
    <h1 class="c16" id="h.qh83kqi5yd6p"><span class="c1">4 Findings and Analysis</span></h1>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">This project reinforced the value of balancing engineering ambition with
            analytical focus. From a technical standpoint, I gained experience managing multiple server environments,
            designing APIs for cross-server communication, and making architectural trade-offs aligned with project
            goals.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span>From an analytical perspective, the project helped shift my mindset. Rather than building for
            the sake of complexity, I began prioritizing clarity, interpretability, and usefulness of insights. EDA
            informed what was worth visualizing, while Python provided the tools to automate and scale that analysis.
            This marked a meaningful transition from full-stack implementation toward </span><span
            class="c4">data-driven reasoning</span><span class="c2 c3">.</span></p>
    <h1 class="c16" id="h.97w2mvwcjaff"><span class="c1">5 Conclusion</span></h1>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">This project represented an intentional step away from building full-stack
            applications alone and toward developing deeper data analytics skills. It taught me that effective data work
            is not about building the most complex system, but about choosing the right tools, simplifying when
            necessary, and focusing on insights that matter.</span></p>
    <p class="c8"><span class="c2 c3">As I continue to transition further into data analytics, I plan to deepen my
            ability to ask stronger analytical questions, extract actionable insights, and automate analysis pipelines
            using Python. This project laid the groundwork for that shift and clarified how I want to position my work
            at the intersection of analytics, engineering, and user-centered design.</span></p>
