      <h1>BetStats</h1>

      <h2>Building Game Insights: Integrating Python Analytics with My Web Projects</h2>
      <p>One of the biggest obstacles I faced while working on my projects was integrating Python tools into websites I had already built. 
        For Bet Stats, my goal was to generate analytical insights and visualizations about player performance and game trends. I knew Python
         (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) would be ideal for processing and graphing the data, but I quickly realized that 
         Python would need to be hosted separately from my main PHP-based website. Setting up the Python server was my first technical challenge. 
         After configuring both environments locally, I figured out how to send a request from my main server (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP) to 
         the Python server, which generated a graph and sent it back as an image. While this solution technically worked, I noticed the images 
         did not render as quickly as expected. This was likely because of the overhead and delay caused by multiple cross-server communications. As 
         I reassessed my priorities, I decided it would be more efficient for now to have the Python server render the graphs directly into an HTML 
         page instead of sending graph images back to the PHP server. This simplified the process and helped me focus on what mattered most at this 
         stage: building, analyzing, and displaying the data effectively.</p>

        <h3>Key Takeaways and Skills Gained:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Server Management: Set up and managed two servers (PHP and Python) locally and remotely.</li>
            <li>Cross-Server Communication: Designed and tested APIs to send requests between separate servers.</li>
            <li>Data Handling: Worked with data extraction, cleaning, and transformation using Python (Pandas, NumPy).</li>
            <li>Visualization: Used Matplotlib to generate graphs dynamically based on uploaded CSV data.</li>
            <li>Problem-Solving: Made tradeoffs between technical complexity and project goals (e.g., simplifying architecture to prioritize data analysis).</li>
        </ul>
    

    <h3>Refocusing on Data Analytics</h3>
    <p>As I transition more heavily into data analytics, I want to shift focus from full-stack project building to working deeply with data itself.
        Through my full-stack projects, I’ve already built a strong understanding of database design, querying, and real-world integration.
        <br><br>Now, I want to strengthen my skills in areas like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Asking better analytical questions</li>
            <li>Finding meaningful and actionable insights</li>
            <li>Using Python to automate and present findings clearly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>My next project will be focused on complex querying and deeper analysis through a project on my ADHD productivity tracking website.
            <br>This will push me to become more comfortable with Python and more confident approaching projects like a professional data analyst.</p>

        <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
        <p>Eventually, I want to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Work with real-world datasets to build case studies</li>
            <li>Develop web applications that automate graph generation and data exploration for users</li>
            <li>Create a portfolio that clearly shows my ability to analyze, visualize, and explain data insights</li>
            <li>Keep sharpening my web development skills, so that I can package and present data in a user-friendly way</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I believe combining technical skills (Python, SQL, web technologies) with strong analytical thinking will help me become 
            a more versatile and impactful data professional.</p>

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
            <p>This project taught me that while building a perfect technical system is exciting, clarity of purpose matters even more.
                Choosing the right tools, simplifying architecture when needed, and focusing on the main goals (clear, meaningful insights) 
                is what will drive my growth as a data analyst.</p>
