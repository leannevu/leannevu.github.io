    <h1>Interactive EDA Dashboard</h1>
    <a href="./blog-insight-productivity.html" class="button" target="_blank">View Full Insights Journal</a>
    </header>
    <h2>Analysis and Story Telling: EDA in Jupyter to presentation and user interactivity in full-stack</h2>
    <p>This project marked a shift from full-stack product building to hands-on data exploration. I dove deep into a large behavioral dataset, adapting my analysis constantly as new questions emerged. It pushed me to think like a data analyst—while drawing on my backend and web development experience to build a platform that connects code, output, and insights in one seamless flow.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Compared to my previous projects, this one was unique in that the star of the show was the exploratory analysis on a large dataset. I put on my analyst hat and dove deep into the data—constantly asking questions and adapting my approach based on what I discovered. Through this process, I developed a stronger sense of expertise with Python and applied my previous knowledge of databases and web development, including CRUD operations and data importing/exporting.</p>
    <p>I also picked up new concepts like file handling, regex-based code highlighting, asynchronous vs. synchronous functions, and designing custom functions and routes to handle data via JSON. This project helped me start thinking more like a data analyst, while sharpening my development skills and staying true to my product-thinking mindset—always focused on shaping meaningful user experiences.</p>

    <h2>Key Takeaways and Skills</h2>
    <div class="flex-row">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Analysis</h3>
        <div class="sticky-notes">
        <div class="note">Practiced asking analytical questions, interpreting unexpected results, and refining hypotheses based on the data</div>
        <div class="note">Reinforced Python fluency while building a data-driven app from scratch using Flask</div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <div class="sticky-notes">
         <div class="note">Combined Jupyter, Flask, and pandas to guide users through analysis step-by-step</div>
         <div class="note">Built a regex-based syntax highlighter to mimick Jupyter-style code presentation on the web for better readability.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>This project made it clear how important it is to not only run calculations, but to ask good questions, evaluate assumptions, and explain the why behind the data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Strengthening my ability to ask sharper analytical questions</li>
      <li>Practicing how to extract actionable insights from messy or ambiguous datasets</li>
      <li>Using Python to automate reports and build visual narratives that clearly communicate findings</li>
      <li>Evaluating the credibility and structure of the dataset</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>This social media vs. productivity project helped me bridge the gap between exploratory analysis and real storytelling. While I didn’t find strong correlations where I expected to, I learned that data rarely tells a simple story upfront—you have to explore, question, and visualize your way through it.</p>
    <p>It also pushed me to think beyond the notebook: to build a full environment where code, results, and insight live together in one interactive platform. I'm excited to keep building on these skills as I start my Master’s in Analytics and begin applying for data-focused internships.</p>
